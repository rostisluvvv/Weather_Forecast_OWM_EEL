# Weather Forecast Stack(OWM&EEL)

This is not just a project of which there are a million on GitHub - this is a real business task that I found on the freelance exchange.

Task:
Web interface with weather forecast. There should be 2 pages: the 1st - with the choice of the city, the 2nd - with the weather for today and for tomorrow in the selected city. Necessarily in Python, how exactly to implement it does not matter. (You can use pyOWM to determine the weather and eel or something similar to create a web interface).
